# RedBaron
RedBaron is a virtual assistant that is intended to be a useful tool that can assist in web-development using live screen recognition to provide context based responses.

In this repo you will find all the files you need as well as three files called dev-log, bug-board, and future featurs. These files should be consulted with when 
in a rut or stuck.
