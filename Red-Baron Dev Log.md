Red-Baron Dev-Log!


Welcome to the E-P.I.C.S Dev-Log! This is where you can update the team on your progress. Every time you make a change, no matter how small, add it to the dev-log so that others know what you did.

To format your entry, start with the date (year/month/day) followed by your name (or pseudonym), then the system or line number you worked on. Next, add a brief description of the changes you made. Be sure to specify the line numbers you changed for easy reference in case of any issues.

If you encounter a bug you can't fix, please add it to the 'RedBaronBugBoard.txt' file, and consider using 'DEBUG' statements to help identify the issue. For examples of 'DEBUG' statements, refer to 'RBDebugExa.txt'. If you need further assistance, contact Marcus Sherman.
